abstract: With the evolution of Industry 4.0 technologies and the increasing complexity of systems in industries, which exhibit unpredictable and undesirable behavior, there is a need to implement advanced control strategies using emerging technologies from Industry 4.0, such as the concept of Digital Twin (DT). This article uses the Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to design a Fuzzy-PD controller and approximate the behavior of nonlinear systems like the Ball and Beam System (BABS). Finally, this research introduces the concept of Digital Twin (DT) to prevent undesired behaviors and visualize the system's physical behavior before implementing it in a real environment.
