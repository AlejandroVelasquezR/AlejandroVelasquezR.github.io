## About Me

Hello and welcome! As an electrical engineering student from [Universidad Tecnologica de Pereira](https://www.utp.edu.co) and a member of the [automatic control research group](https://sites.google.com/utp.edu.co/controlautomatico/), I have a particular passion for the fields of artificial intelligence, renewable energy, coding, and robotic systems. I believe that these areas have the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, and I am eager to learn more about them.

In addition to my interest in automatic control, I am also passionate about coding. I enjoy working on coding projects in my free time, and I am particularly interested in Frontend programming. I find it satisfying to create user interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing.

Overall, I am very enthusiastic about pursuing my interests in electrical engineering, and I am always looking for ways to learn more and explore new opportunities. I believe that this field has tremendous potential to make a positive impact on society, and I am eager to be a part of it.
